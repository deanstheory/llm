        "text": "selection of optimal algorithms to \ndiscretize model variables, and the \nselection of appropriate machine learning \ntechniques to learn the model from the \ndata. The team followed information \ntheory principles to discretize model \nvariables to maximize the model’s \npredictive power, and to represent the \ndata as closely as possible with the \nleast amount of network complexity. \nBooz Allen segmented the model \nvariables into three different categories \nbased on the time to ﬂight departure: \n24 hours, 11 hours, and one hour. \nCertain ﬂight variables could only \nbe known for speciﬁc pre-departure \ntimes. For example, the tarmac and \nairspace congestion variables for \na ﬂight are only known just before \nthe ﬂight, and hence those variables \nfeature only in the one hour category. \nDeparture delays were predicted for \neach of the three time horizons. ››\nTHE FIELD  GUIDE to  DATA  SCIENCE"
